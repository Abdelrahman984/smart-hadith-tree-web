# Changelog: Advanced Features Integration

**Date:** September 6, 2026
**Summary:** This session focused on integrating a robust dataset (Itqan) and building advanced analytical, AI, and interactive features on top of the base graph architecture.

## 1. Itqan Dataset Integration (ETL)
Replaced legacy/manual data ingestion with a fully automated ETL pipeline for the open-source `Itqan` repository.
- **Data Extracted**: Over 115,000 unified narrators, 7,200 Hadiths from Sahih Al-Bukhari, 22,000 transmission links, and 106,000 scholar evaluations (Jarh wa Ta'deel).
- **Backend Changes**: Added `ItqanId` and `ItqanGrade` to the `Narrator` EF Core entity. Built `ItqanDatasetParser.cs` to ingest and map the complex JSON schema directly into SQL Server.

## 2. RAG & AI Integration (Phase 1)
Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) feature using Microsoft Semantic Kernel.
- **Backend (`AiEvaluationService`)**: Created a service that pulls all classical scholar evaluations (e.g., Al-Dhahabi, Ibn Hajar) from the database and injects them into an LLM prompt. The LLM acts as an expert Hadith scholar, synthesizing the conflicting quotes into a single, cohesive Arabic verdict.
- **Frontend (`NarratorDrawer.tsx`)**: Wired up a UI button to trigger the API endpoint and stream the AI summary to the user.

## 3. Advanced Full-Text Search (Phase 2)
Polished the global search functionality to allow researchers to find Hadiths by their raw Arabic text (`MatnArabic`) and book source.
- **Implementation**: The backend normalizes Arabic search inputs and uses `Contains` to find exact matches across texts and narrator aliases.
- **UI**: A dedicated `/search` page routes users to the interactive tree view for any matched Hadith.

## 4. Graph Analytics & Inqita' Detection (Phase 3)
Added chronological anomaly detection to the Isnad engine to flag mathematically impossible transmission chains.
- **Backend Logic**: Post-processes the recursive CTE output to compare a Student's `BirthYearHijri` against their Sheikh's `DeathYearHijri`. If the student was born after the sheikh died, the node is flagged with `IsAnomaly = true`.
- **Frontend Visualization**: The React Flow engine (`TreeCanvas.tsx`) renders anomalous edges as thick, dashed red lines labeled "انقطاع" (Inqita'). The `NarratorNode` component also displays a `lucide-react` warning icon with the exact reason on hover.

## 5. Interactive UI Filters & Exports (Phase 4)
Gave users more control over the complex graph canvas:
- **Filter**: Added a "Highlight Weak Links" toggle via `GraphControls.tsx`. This dynamically adjusts the opacity of all `reliable` narrators down to 30%, isolating problematic/weak links in the chain for quick visual inspection.
- **Export**: Integrated `html-to-image` to capture the entire React Flow viewport, allowing academics to download high-resolution, perfectly scaled PNGs of the Isnad trees for sharing.
